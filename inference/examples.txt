This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients diagnosed with essential hypertension. The study enrolled 450 participants aged 45-70 years with systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an ACE inhibitor (enalapril 10-20 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included changes in diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. Results showed a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in the ACE inhibitor group compared to placebo (mean difference: -12.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -15.1 to -9.5, p<0.001). The incidence of dry cough, a known adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, was higher in the treatment group (15.2%) compared to placebo (2.1%). The study concluded that ACE inhibitors are effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, though clinicians should monitor for common adverse effects.
